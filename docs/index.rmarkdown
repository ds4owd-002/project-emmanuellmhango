## Uganda Waterpoints

This dataset provides comprehensive information on water points across Uganda. This dataset is a free dataset shared through [The Humanitatian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wpdx_uga "Uganda Water points Data"). Each entry represents an individual water source, such as a well or a rainwater harvesting system, with associated details covering location, type, functionality, management, and usage.

Key attributes include:

-   **Geographical information:** Latitude, longitude, and administrative divisions (region, district, sub-county).

-   **Water source and technology:** The type of water source (e.g., protected well, rainwater harvesting) and the technology used.

-   **Operational status:** Whether the water point is functional or non-functional.

-   **Management and governance:** How the water point is managed (community-managed, fee-based, etc.) and the organization responsible.

-   **Installation and maintenance history:** Year of installation, rehabilitation records, and organizations involved.

-   **Population served:** The number of people served within the vicinity of the water point.

-   **Water quality indicators:** Includes parameters such as fecal contamination presence and subjective quality assessments.

-   **Proximity metrics:** Distances to urban centers, primary, secondary, and tertiary water sources.

**Analysis Goals:**\
The primary goals of analyzing this dataset are:

1.  **Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E):** Assess the operational status and functionality of water points across different regions to track performance, identify trends, and support evidence-based decision-making.

2.  **Risk Assessment:** Identify areas at higher risk of water point failure, contamination, or insufficient coverage to prioritize interventions, rehabilitation, and resource allocation.

This dataset serves as a detailed resource for monitoring water access and quality in Uganda, supporting strategic planning, management effectiveness assessment, and risk-informed decision-making for water infrastructure.

## Import

To load the data, you should first load the required libraries to use:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
library(knitr)
library(DT)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, load your dataset like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
data <- read_csv(here::here("data/raw/wpdx_enhanced.csv"))
```

Now, we will write code to bring your data into a state where it’s ready for analysis.

-   Rename columns with `rename()`

-   Select columns that are relevant with `select()`

-   Remove missing values with `filter()` or `drop_na()`

-   Join several dataframes with `left_join()`, `right_join()`, etc.

-   Create new variables with `mutate()`

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| warning: false
data <- data |>
   select(
    -c(
      prediction_yes_0y,
      prediction_yes_2y,
      prediction_no_0y,
      prediction_no_2y,
      clean_adm1,
      clean_adm2,
      clean_adm3,
      clean_adm4,
      activity_id,
      scheme_id,
      notes,
      wpdx_id,
      predicted_status_0y,
      predicted_status_2y,
      predicted_category
    )
  ) |>
  rename(water_source_type = water_source_clean) |>
  mutate(report_date = mdy(report_date)) |>
  mutate(report_date = format(report_date, "%d/%m/%Y"))
```

Save the processed data into a CSV file

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
write_csv(data,
          here::here("data/processed/my-processed-data.csv"))
```

## Visualization

Visualization is important because it helps to visually represents the data. We will visualize 2 graphs for the dataset:

### 1. Bar graph of impacted people by the resource type

This visualization shows the total population impacted by the functional status of the waterpoint.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Summary of population affected by water point status
population_status <- data %>%
  group_by(status_clean) %>%
  summarize(total_population = sum(assigned_population, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
ggplot(population_status, aes(x = status_clean, y = total_population, fill = status_clean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Population Affected by Water Point Functionality",
    x = "Water Point Status",
    y = "Total Population Affected"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = ",")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::label_number(big.mark = ",")(total_population)), hjust = -0.1) +
   theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### 2. Scatter Plot (Criticality vs Pressure)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between pressure (how heavily a water point is used) and criticality (how essential or high-risk the water point is).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
data |> 
  drop_na(pressure, criticality) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = pressure, y = criticality)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 2, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Criticality vs Pressure",
    x = "Pressure (Usage Pressure)",
    y = "Criticality Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Summary of the 5 selected data variables

```{r}
#| label: tbl-statistics
#| tbl-cap: Summary of Key Variables

data |>
  select(local_population, assigned_population, usage_cap, pressure, distance_to_city) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),
    names_to = "Variable",
    values_to = "Value"
  ) |>
  group_by(Variable) |>
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Std. Dev` = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
    gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Summary of Key Variables",
             subtitle = "Summary per waterpoint")  |>
fmt_number(
    columns = vars(Mean, Median, `Std. Dev`),
    decimals = 0,
    use_seps = TRUE
  ) 

```

In @tbl-statistics, you can see that standard deviation is generally big. The High SD means that the population assigned to water points varies hugely. Some water points serve very few people, others serve more.

Furthermore,in the same @tbl-statistics, the small mean and median but larger SD for pressure suggests that pressure values are skewed. some points have extreme under usage unlike others.
